## Motivation

Current spare-time project to strengthen what I have learned within the past months:

- React
- Node
- GraphQL

## Backend

The backend runs with ![Logo for graph-ql](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/389368863d9b9df25acd07644bad7642459c3533/68747470733a2f2f696d6775722e636f6d2f5376366a3042362e706e67 "graphql-yoga Logo") [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga).
The GraphQL server wraps for now the REST-API of [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

## Frontend

The frontend runs with React and Apollo client.
