## Motivation

Current spare-time project to strengthen what I have learned within the past months:

- React
- Node
- GraphQL

## Backend

The backend runs with [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga).
The GraphQL server wraps for now the REST-API of [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

## Frontend

The frontend runs with React and Apollo client.
